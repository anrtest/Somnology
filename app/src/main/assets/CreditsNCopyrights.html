He has accumulated 24 different bells carefully chosen for clarity and purity of sound, sustained resonance, and harmonic blending or pairing with other bowls within the set. He has created music for meditations, museums, yoga, tai chi, and special celebrations of all kinds. He added the Longhorn Native American flute and Conch shells to his music, which, along with the Tibetan bells, create harmonic vibrations that gently penetrate the body of the listener to guide them into a relaxed and meditative state. He has a gallery in San Francisco, CA and has played his music all over the world.
